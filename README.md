Simple application to work with aws 
Includes:

python project which iterates over 100x100 rectangle with constant calls to db to update it's position
python lambdas functions to work with data in cloud

basic frontend with prepared services to fetch relevant data from database located at aws (DynamoDb)


Issues:
I've set api gateway, prepared correct endpoints and even disabled authentication but still calls are being rejected
by gateway and i cannot figure out why.
